# @streamster/usgs

Firstly, a big thanks to the folks over at USGS for all of their hardwork in developing their Water Services. Much much appreciated!

@streamster/usgs is a JavaScript library designed to make working with the USGS Water Services significantly easier. Currently, the package provides a way to easily query the Daily and Instantaneous services. The data can be returned from the service as is or re-structured to a more friendly time-series format that is easy to display in a table or chart.

## Getting Started

To install the package

```bash
# yarn
yarn add @streamster/usgs

# npm
npm install @streamster/usgs
```
