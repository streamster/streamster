# Streamster

Streamster is a JavaScript library designed to make working with water resource related APIs simpler. Currently, Streamster supports querying the [USGS Daily Values](https://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/DV-Test-Tool.html). It is still very much a work in progress.

## Roadmap
I am hoping to add support for all of [USGS Water Services](https://waterservices.usgs.gov) as well as the some of the Colorado DWR web services.
