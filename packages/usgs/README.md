# @streamster/usgs

Streamster is a JavaScript library designed to make working with water resource related APIs simpler. Currently, Streamster supports querying the [USGS Daily Values](https://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/DV-Test-Tool.html) and [USGS Instantaneous Values](https://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/IV-Test-Tool.html) services. It is still very much a work in progress, but currently allows querying by a variety location, parameter, and time period arguments.

## Roadmap

I am hoping to add support for all of [USGS Water Services](https://waterservices.usgs.gov) as well as the some of the Colorado DWR web services.
